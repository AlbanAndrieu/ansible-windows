  Windows service definition for Jenkins agent.
  This service is powered by the WinSW project: https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw/

  You can find more information about available options here: https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw/blob/master/doc/xmlConfigFile.md
  Configuration examples are available here: https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw/tree/master/examples

  To uninstall, run "jenkins-slave.exe stop" to stop the service, then "jenkins-slave.exe uninstall" to uninstall the service.
  Both commands don't produce any output if the execution is successful.

    If uncommented, download the Remoting version provided by the Jenkins master.
    Enabling for HTTP implies security risks (e.g. replacement of JAR via DNS poisoning). Use on your own risk.
    NOTE: This option may fail to work correctly (e.g. if Jenkins is located behind HTTPS with untrusted certificate).
    In such case the old agent version will be used; you can replace slave.jar manually or to specify another download URL.
